Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            51 out of   1,408    3%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               179 out of   1,408   12%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            121 out of     704   17%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     121 out of     121 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     121   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         194 out of   1,408   13%
    Number used as logic:               171
    Number used as a route-thru:         15
    Number used as 16x1 RAMs:             8

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 24 out of     108   22%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.27

Peak Memory Usage:  4435 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   5 secs
